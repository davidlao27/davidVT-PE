 davidVT (P)rocessing (E)dition Project Source and Releases.
 
**JAVA 17 IS REQUIRED OR THE PROGRAM WONT START CORRECTLY.**
 
 The build.bat file is used to copy the images to the exports.
 
 # How to Use
 davidVT PE requires a keyboard, mouse or touchpad and microphone to work.
 
 It is also recommended to have a decent computer, as java applications may be resource intensive sometimes.
 <br><br>
 
 **The Keyboard:**
 
 Q and E are used to go back and forth in the Choose Mode menu.
 
 The current mode being used is shown on the top right:<br>
 0: Normal (None)<br>
 1: Bopping (Move open.png slightly up to "bop" whenever you talk)<br>
 2: Alternating (When talking, your computer decides between using open.png and open_alt.png)<br>
 3: Bopping Alternating (Features from mode 1 plus mode 2, all together. Usually looks the best)<br>
 
 **The Mouse/Touchpad:**
 
 Not much of this is used currently. Scroll with your mouse or touchpad to vary the "lowest volume required" to talk.<br>
 You can see how much volume you're giving by seeing the label next to it which says "(current)".
 
 For example, if while talking to your microphone you get 0.1, play around until you think the program responds correctly to your speech. (Personally I use 0.05 or 0.06 as I don't talk too loud)<br>
 
 **The microphone**
 
 The microphone simply acts as a volume input, you talk to it and the program recieves the volume.<br>
 (On other cases for different programs, it may also be used as a speech recognition device or something else.)
